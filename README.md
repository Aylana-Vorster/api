Playtesting APIs 

Note: API keys can be obtained online and set in a config.yaml file

Here are a few APIs playtested in different ways. Specifically:
    1. Getting the astronomy picture of the day (APOD) from NASA, writing the description of the picture on the picture itself, and then set it as your Windows background. One may run this daily or set it to run automatically so one always comes online to the APOD
